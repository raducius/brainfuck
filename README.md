Very Simple Brainf*ck Interpreter 0.0.1 (VSBI)

Does not currently support nested loops. This will be changed.

If you attempt to run a BF program that utilises nested loops, anything could happen - (unlikely) your program will work correctly, (very likely) your program will segfault, (probably unlikely) your program will blow up your computer or (possibility) your program will summon Cthulhu and unleash unspeakable horrors from incomprehensible dimensions bringing about a thousand years of madness. 

In the unlikely event of damage to your computer, or the sudden unleash of hordes of Lovecraftian horrors upon the unprepared earth, I will not be held accountable. 

Best of luck.
